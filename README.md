v0.21.0
* v1.0 support

v0.20.1
* Fixed typo in Maple tree definition causing errors

* Snowy definitions are now XML based- this means that Snowy Trees can now be used as a platform to snow-ify plants and trees from other mods

v0.19.2
* Fixed bug that caused plants in the leafless state but have no leafless sprite to not swap the regular sprite when snowed on.

v0.19.1
* Fixed bug that caused errors when plants added by other mods got snowed on.

v0.19.0
* Refactored the tree swap code, not that it was an issue, but by making fewer string comparisons it runs faster now.

* Added snow graphics for Agave and Willow Tree.

0.18.0t
